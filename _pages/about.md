Yuer Chen's Homepage.

I am a Ph.D. student of the [School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn). My research interests lie in
+ Numerical linear algrebra: large-scale eigenvalue problem and linear equations,
+ Numerical approxiamtion: rational approximation and polynominal approximation,
+ Circuit simulation: transient simulation, signal integrity analysis,

and also the numerical methods of nonlinear equation, mathematical modeling.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Young researcher [Yingzhou Li](https://yingzhouli.com), [School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn).

You can find my CV here: [Yuer Chen's CV-English](../files/cv-English.pdf) and [Yuer Chen's CV-Chinese](../files/cv-Chinese.pdf).
